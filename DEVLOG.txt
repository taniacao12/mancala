We apologize for not being detailed...
We couldn't really keep up with our plan.

We did divide up the work pretty fairly, here's the summary of what we did:
Fareeha: DESIGN document, basic socket, player-to-server-to-player communication, taking turns, instructions, print, README, DEVLOG
Tania: DESIGN document, stringify, listify, flip, update, print, instructions, initial main in client.c

We both helped each other out and contributed to everything listed here, but I just listed the main person taking care of each thing.
